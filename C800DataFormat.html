<h1>SMW's Level block format</h1>
In SMW's levels, RAM address $C800 in banks $7E/$7F ($40/$41 in SA-1) contains all the block data of layer 1 and 2 (if the level is a layer 2 level). They hold the map 16 number/ID
for every tile in the current level with the low bytes in bank $7E ($40 SA-1) and high bytes in bank $7F ($41 SA-1). The format of the blocks as follows:
<h2>Horizontal levels</h2>
<ol>
<li>Within each screen column, each subsequent byte in memory starting at $C800 is the next block in level from left to right and then next row from left to right again (row-major):<br>

<li>Once the <b>bottom</b> of the level is reached, the next screen column starting from the top-left and repeats the pattern. Note that this continues down the screen columns even if there
are multiple rows of screen boundaries and not the next &ldquo;screen number&rdquo; displayed in Lunar Magic:<br>

</ol>
<h2>Vertical levels</h2>
<ol>
<li>Similar to horizontal levels, but does the row-major format within each half (or every subscreen boundary) of the screen:<br>

<li>Once the last block of the screen boundary is reached, it repeats the whole process on the next screen.<br>
