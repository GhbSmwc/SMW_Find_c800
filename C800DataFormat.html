<h1>SMW's Level block format</h1>
In SMW's levels, RAM address <kbd>$C800</kbd> in banks <kbd>$7E</kbd>/<kbd>$7F</kbd> (<kbd>$40</kbd>/<kbd>$41</kbd> in SA-1) contains all the block data of layer 1 and 2
(if the level is a layer 2 level). They hold the map 16 number/ID for every tile in the current level with the low bytes in bank <kbd>$7E</kbd> (<kbd>$40</kbd> SA-1)
and high bytes in bank <kbd>$7F</kbd> (<kbd>$41</kbd> SA-1). The format of the blocks as follows:
<h2>Byte format</h2>
Because map16 numbers are 16-bit numbers (in the original SMW, they're technically 9-bits as page 0 and 1 are only used, but have to have another full byte due to being a table and that a byte
is the smallest addressable unit of memory), they have their low and high bytes stored separately in bank <kbd>$7E</kbd> (<kbd>$40</kbd> for SA-1) for the low byte and bank <kbd>$7F</kbd>
(<kbd>$41</kbd> in SA-1) for the high byte. For example, if the first block stored in memory (top-left block on any level format) is <kbd>$<font color="red">01</font><font color="blue">30</font></kbd>
(cement block), then <kbd>$7EC800 ($40C800)</kbd> would have a single byte saying <kbd>$<font color="blue">30</font></kbd> and <kbd>$7FC800 ($41C800)</kbd>'s byte saying <kbd>$<font color="red">01</font></kbd>.<br><br>
Each next byte in both tables means each next block in the level:<br><br>

<table>
<tr>
<td></th>
<th>+0 (<kbd>$C800</kbd>)</th>
<th>+1 (<kbd>$C801</kbd>)</th>
<th>+2 (<kbd>$C802</kbd>)</th>
<th>+3 (<kbd>$C803</kbd>)</th>
<th>...</th>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>&lt;FirstBlock_LowByte&gt;</td>

<td>&lt;FourthBlock_HighByte&gt;</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>

</table>

<h2>Horizontal levels</h2>
<ol>
<li>Within each screen column, each subsequent byte in memory starting at <kbd>$C800</kbd> is the next block in level from left to right and then the next row downwards from left to right again (row-major):<br>
<img src="Readme_files/SMW_RowMajorBlocksPerScreen.png"></li>
<li>Once the <b>bottom</b> of the level is reached, the next screen column starting from the top-left and repeats the pattern. Note that the order the screen boundaries the blocks are stored is from top to bottom on each screen boundary,
then the next column left to right (column-major). Meaning after the last block within a screen boundary, the next block is on another screen boundary <b>below</b> it when there is multiple rows of screen boundaries (at least level dimension setting <kbd>$0D</kbd>).
The screen block-order is not ordered the same as the &ldquo;screen number&rdquo; shown in Lunar Magic:<br>
<img src="Readme_files/SMW_ColumnMajorScreenColumn.png"></li>
</ol>
<h3>Calculating the coordinates and reverse.</h3>
<img src="Readme_files/ComputationHorizLevel.png">
<ol>
<li>Formula to calculate to find the index is <kbd>Index = (BlocksPerScrnCol * floor(XPos/16)) + (YPos*16) + (XPos MOD 16)</kbd>.</li>
<li>Formula to calculate to find the coordinates is:
<ul>
<li><kbd>XPos = (floor(BlockIndex/BlocksPerScreenCol)*16) + (Index MOD 16)</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>YPos = floor((BlockIndex MOD BlocksPerScreenCol)/16)</kbd></li>
</ul>

<kbd>BlocksPerScreenCol</kbd> Is simply RAM address <kbd>$13D7</kbd> (if in a SA-1 ROM, that is <kbd>$13D7|!addr</kbd> &rightarrow; <kbd>$73D7</kbd>). This not only contains the level height in pixels, it is also the number of blocks
per screen column.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Vertical levels</h2>
<ol>
<li>Similar to horizontal levels, but does the row-major format within each half (or every subscreen boundary) of the screen:<br>
<img src="Readme_files/SMW_VerticalLevelFormat.png"></li>
<li>Once the last block of the screen boundary is reached, it repeats the whole process on the next screen.<br>
<img src="Readme_files/SMW_VerticalLevelFormatByScreen.png"></li>
</ol>
<h3>Calculating the coordinates and reverse.</h3>
<img src="Readme_files/ComputationVertLevel.png">
<ol>
<li>Similar to horizontal levels, but because there are no dimension settings for vertical levels, the task is much easier, and even more so thanks
to the fact that each screen's width and height and the number of blocks are all powers of 2, making easy use of bitwise operations. In fact, the index
in binary is <kbd>%00YYYYYXyyyyxxxx</kbd>, where uppercase X and Y represents what screen boundary and what halves (X = 0 for left and 1 for right)
within a screen boundary.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Formula to calculate to find the index is <kbd>Index = (512 * floor(YPos/16)) + (256 * floor(XPos/16)) + ((YPos MOD 16)*16) + (XPos MOD 16)</kbd></li>
<li>To get the coordinates:
<ul>
<li><kbd>XPos = (floor((BlockIndex MOD 512)/256)*16) + (BlockIndex MOD 16)</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>YPos = (floor(BlockIndex/512)*16) + (floor(BlockIndex/16) MOD 16)</kbd></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other information</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>When using Layer 2 (or layer 3) levels, the width of the level in horizontal levels or the height in vertical levels is halved, rounded downwards to
the nearest screen boundary. The other &ldquo;half&rdquo; (in quotes because it is not always exactly) of the $C800 table is used up by layer 2/3 in the
same data format order pattern as layer 1.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is an odd number of H-screens, such as &ldquo;<kbd>$06: Height=$026 tiles, MaxHScreens=$17</kbd>&rdquo; on a layer 2 horizontal level, there
is a gap between the last byte of layer 1 and the first byte of layer 2 of a size equal to the number of blocks per screen column. For example of the mentioned setting:<br>
<img src="Readme_files/GapBetweenLayer1And2.png"><br>
I placed the blocks in an increasing map16 number order, with layer 1 blocks on the bottom of the last screen and layer 2 on the top of the first screen so you can see
it easier when viewed on a debugger. Looking at memory editor we can see there is an unused gap:<br>
<img src="Readme_files/GapBetweenLayer1And2Dbg.png"><br>
Notice the gap ranging from <kbd>$7EE220</kbd> to <kbd>$7EE47F</kbd> (this also applies to the other bank, as their data position corresponds). This gap is 608 ($260 in hex) bytes long, this is also
the number of blocks per screen column (16*38 = 608). This gap being the number of blocks per screen column bytes long always works when having any odd-number
of H-screens for a layer 2 level. It's unknown why <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=8251">Vitor Vilela</a>/<a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=9435">FuSoYa</a>
to position the layer 2 data table in such a position, probably due to the rounding of the number of screens downwards to an integer as odd numbers isn't
divisible by 2.</p></li>
<li><p>If you write to the <kbd>$C800</kbd> table, it <b>does</b> change the map16 number like you would with GPS's <kbd>change_map16</kbd> routine, however, the graphics will not be updated until
it is refreshed by level loading (during the screen fades to the level) or when re-entering the player's screen after being scrolled offscreen far enough. This is to prevent
V-blank overflow by updating the graphics only when necessary at the moment the block is changed during a map16 change routine (instead of writing to V-RAM's
tilemap and checking every block every frame). You can avoid this graphical glitch by:
<ul>
<li>Changing the blocks during UberasmTool's level <kbd>load:</kbd> feature. Note: This executes at the time after the level is cleared (writing all tiles $0025 via
<kbd>$0582C8</kbd> and <kbd>$05833A</kbd>) and before any LM-placed blocks (all objects and direct map16 tiles), therefore avoid placing any tiles using LM on the spot
you are going to write your block using uberasm tool's <kbd>load:</kbd>.</li>
<li>Changing the blocks that are offscreen, beyond the &ldquo;loading seam&rdquo; (a column or row of blocks at the edge of the screen that loads the appropriate graphics to the tilemap).</li>
<li>Have the block it is changing from and to uses the exact same graphic, so the graphics are unnoticeable. Rarely ever you would need this, purposes like if sprites are &ldquo;pseudo-solid&rdquo; by writing
the blocks they lie on a solid invisible tile instead of using a routine that message boxes, red ? light switch, and invisible solid sprite block (sprite <kbd>#$6D</kbd>) uses, that prevents the player from going through
the sprite.</li>
</ul></p></li>
<li><p>The rightmost boundary for horizontal levels and the bottommost boundary for vertical levels the routines uses to determine if the given coordinate is beyond that boundary is NOT always
the rightmost/bottommost edge that LM would allow placing stuff there, rather RAM address <kbd>$5E</kbd> (horizontal levels) and <kbd>$5F</kbd> (vertical level), these specify the width and
height of the level in number of screens (and where the screen stops scrolling rightwards or downwards). This boundary can be a lower number than the full width and height of the level.
For example: A horizontal level with a setting of <kbd>$04: Height=$022 tiles, MaxHScreens=$1A</kbd> with $5E set to $02 (screens 0 and 1 are accessible in-game), if you give a coordinate
that is beyond screen column 1 (the position the screen stops scrolling rightwards), would flag this as &ldquo;out of bounds&rdquo;, despite being block X position is at or lower than $19F
(the rightmost X position possible to be placed in the level in LM). Therefore, this &ldquo;out of bounds&rdquo; detection for the rightmost or bottomost uses the border where the screen ends
at, not where the level's full dimension ends at. This is set by LM's &ldquo;Number of Screens&rdquo; in &ldquo;Change Properties in Header&rdquo; dialog (don't forget to uncheck the
&ldquo;Auto-Set Number of Screens&rdquo; in the &ldquo;General Options&rdquo; if you need to change that).</p></li>

<li><p>Thankfully, during block interaction (including during custom block code), <kbd>$98</kbd>-<kbd>$9B</kbd> (scratch RAM <kbd>$0A</kbd>-<kbd>$0D</kbd> for sprites after executing <kbd>$019138</kbd>) while processing layer 2,
their XY positions are relative to the top-left of layer 2, not the level, so this means that if you touch the top-left block on layer 2, regardless of the layer 2 positioning ((<kbd>$1E</kbd> or
<kbd>$1466</kbd>), (<kbd>$20</kbd> or <kbd>$1468</kbd>)), collision point will read as (<kbd>$000*</kbd>, <kbd>$000*</kbd>). This means you simply take the coordinates as if they're layer 1, use the routine
to convert to <kbd>$C800</kbd> indexing, and then load where the byte starts for layer 2. The list of layer 2 address follows:

<a href="JS_C800Converter.html">I've included an HTML file</a> that uses javascript to compute the index and position much easier without pasting it in the calculator and manually setting up the variables.
