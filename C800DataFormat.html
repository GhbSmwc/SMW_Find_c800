<h1>SMW's Level block format</h1>
In SMW's levels, RAM address $C800 in banks $7E/$7F ($40/$41 in SA-1) contains all the block data of layer 1 and 2. They hold the map 16 numbers for every tile in the current level
with the low bytes in bank $7E ($40 SA-1) and high bytes in bank $7F ($41 SA-1). The format of the blocks as follows:
<h2>Horizontal levels</h2>
<ol>
<li>Within each screen column, each subsequent byte in memory starting at $C800 is the next block in level from left to right and then from top to bottom (row-major):<br>

<li>Once the bottom of the level is reached, the next screen column is reached and repeats (column-major). Note that I mention screen <b>column</b>, meaning if there are multiple screens columns,
it proceeds downwards to the screen <b>below it</b>, not across like screen exit being numbered in Lunar Magic:<br>
